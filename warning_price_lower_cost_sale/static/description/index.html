    On retail store customers can do negotiate the product that they want.
    But sometimes a cashier can do some mistake such change the product price lower than the product cost.
  </p>
  <p>Using this module we can give an alert like red color on the product order line if cashiers do that mistake.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Here is the the result in the Sales Order form.</h3>
  <p>
    The cost of the item is IDR 60.000. <br>
    The entered unit price on the first row is IDR 50.000 so the row is displayed in red. <br>
    On the same product the unit price of the second line is IDR 62.000 so it is displayed in the normal color.
